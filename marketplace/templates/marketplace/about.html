  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>Hi, I’m Sai — a passionate student and aspiring entrepreneur from Tamil Nadu. I’m the creator of this platform, designed to help students buy and sell used books, find new study materials, and connect with each other in smarter, more affordable ways.</p>
  <p>I’m deeply interested in technology, startups, and innovation, and I’m currently learning full-stack web development, ethical hacking, app development, and AI — all while working hard to secure a seat at IIT Madras, my dream institution.</p>
  <p>This website isn’t just a project — it’s my mission to make education more accessible and helpful for every student. I’m also building features like verified sellers, student delivery options, and an AI buddy to support both academics and emotional well-being.</p>
  <p>Thanks for visiting — I hope this platform helps you grow, save, and succeed!</p>
